# Pong - Monogame

***This game is made using the Monogame framework, the purpose of this game is just to train problem solving skills and bug analysis related to programming, the ability to program something can only be improved by direct practice.*** <br> <br>
***However, practicing making programs without examples will be very difficult, so I decided to take *PONG* as an example in making this first project***
